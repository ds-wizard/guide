Document Template List
**********************

As **data stewards** and **admins**, we can check and manage all document templates from the list accessible from the main menu via :menuselection:`Documents > Templates`. The list can be filtered and sorted by name.

For each document template, we can see the latest version present; however, we can see all the versions by accessing the :doc:`./detail` by clicking the name of the template or via :guilabel:`View detail` from the right dropdown item menu. The dropdown menu also offers :guilabel:`Export` of the latest document template or :guilabel:`Delete` of entire template (all its versions).

.. NOTE::

    A document template can be deleted only if it is not used already for documents, projects, or settings.

Each item may be marked with *unsupported metamodel* if the document template is not compatible with the version of DSW. Also, *upgrade available* may appear if there is a newer version of the template in the `DSW Registry <https://registry.ds-wizard.org>`__ (and if configured).

Finally, we can use :guilabel:`Import` new document templates by clicking the top right button (see :doc:`./import` for details).
