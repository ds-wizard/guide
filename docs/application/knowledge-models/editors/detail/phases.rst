Phases
******

If there are any :ref:`project phases<phase>` set up in the knowledge model, we can use the :guilabel:`Phases` tab to see an overview of which questions were assigned to be completed in each phase and to change the phase assignments.

We can simply click to the checkbox in the corresponding phase - question table cell to assign/unassign the phase to that particular question.
