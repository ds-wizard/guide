Document Template Editor
************************

A document template editor allows us to edit both configuration and all files of a document template. We can manage the configuration (such as template metadata, formats, and steps) on the :doc:`./settings` tab. The files including directories can be managed (created, edited, deleted, or uploaded) on the :doc:`./files` tab. Finally, the :doc:`./preview` tab allows us to quickly check how the document template works for a certain project and format and how the resulting document looks like.

There is also option to :doc:`./publish` the document template via :guilabel:`Publish` button in the top right corner.
