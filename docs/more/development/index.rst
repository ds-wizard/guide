Development
***********

|project_name| can be extended in many ways and new components and ways of integrations can be developed to support our needs. Besides the API available for everything that can be done in |project_name|, new :ref:`integration questions<integration_questions>` and :ref:`project importers<development-importers>` can be implemented to get data from outside to |project_name|, or new :ref:`document templates<document-template-development>` and :ref:`submission services<submission-service>` can be created to get the data outside of |project_name| in the desired form.

This section provides information on how to develop custom content for |project_name| to fully tailor the tool to our specific requirements.
