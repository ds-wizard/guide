From DSW Registry
=================

If the DSW instance is connected to the `DSW Registry <https://registry.ds-wizard.org>`__, it is possible to import knowledge models from it by entering the **knowledge model ID** of desired template (e.g. ``dsw:lifesciences:2.4.0``) and pressing the :guilabel:`Import` button.

.. NOTE::

    In case of knowledge model present in the `DSW Registry <https://registry.ds-wizard.org>`__, we will be notified about the available upgrades.


From file
=========

We can import a knowledge model as a KM file. Such a file can be created as an export from DSW (from :doc:`./index` or :doc:`./detail`).
