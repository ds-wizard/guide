Preview
*******

The :guilabel:`Preview` tab of :doc:`./index` allows us to quickly check how our document template works and how the resulting document looks like for a selected project and document format. We can select any **Project** that we are allowed to view. Then, we select the desired **Format** (one of those specified on the :doc:`./settings` tab of the editor). Any change in the template configuration and its files will trigger re-generation of the preview (we can simply click the :guilabel:`Preview` tab again).

.. note::

    A good practice is to open the document template editor in a different browser tab than editor opened on the :doc:`./files` or :doc:`./settings` tab. Moreover, we can also open the project that we use for preview.
