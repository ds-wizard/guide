Users
*****

Users list allows administrators to see and manage all users in a |project_name| instance. The list can be filtered using role, searched based using name or email fragment, and sorted via various properties of users. The list shows the role of a user next to its name and also indicates in case the user is inactive. Next to the email, we can quickly see what authentication services the user uses to log-in (:guilabel:`internal` is the internal authentication with email-password credentials, other are based on configured :ref:`OpenID services<auth-services>`).

A :ref:`user detail<user-detail>` can be opened by clicking the name of a user or by selecting :guilabel:`Edit` in the right dropdown menu for the desired row. There, a user can be also deleted via the :guilabel:`Delete` action. Finally, administrator can :ref:`create a new user<user-create>` by clicking :guilabel:`Create`.
