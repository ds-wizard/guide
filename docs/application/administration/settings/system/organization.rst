Organization Settings
*********************

On this page, we can configure **Name**, **Description**, **Organization ID** for our |project_name| instance and **Affiliations**.

The organization ID is used as a part of knowledge models and document templates IDs. That ID is also used in the :ref:`dsw-registry` to identify the organization. 

The **Affiliations** list is used to pre-define a list of possible affiliations (on per line) that will be suggested to users while they register or update their profiles.

.. NOTE::

    It is recommended to use period as for domain name or to use it for capturing organizational structure in the ID, for example, ``faculty.university`` or ``group.faculty.university``.
