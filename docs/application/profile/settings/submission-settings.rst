Submission Settings
*******************

If there are any :ref:`submission-service` configured and require additional user properties, we can set those values under **Submission Settings**. Those properties are then used in the request settings of the submission service. For example, if the submission service requires an API token, we can set it here.

If there is no submission service that requires additional properties, there is a note that no settings are available.

.. NOTE::

    The admin should notify users about the required properties for the submission service.
