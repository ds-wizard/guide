    List of knowledge model editors.


We can use the search field to search for a specific KM editor. The editors are sorted by when they were last updated but we can change that.

We can :ref:`create a new knowledge model editor<create-knowledge-model-editor>` by clicking the :guilabel:`Create` button.

By clicking the triple dots on each of the item in the list we can access some actions:

- **Open Editor** - simply open the :ref:`editor detail<knowledge-model-editor>`
- **Upgrade** - if there is a newer version of parent knowledge model, we can use upgrade action to start a :ref:`knowledge model migration<knowledge-model-migration>`, otherwise the action is not visible
- **Publish** - to :ref:`publish<knowledge-model-publish>` a new version of the knowledge model
- **Delete** - to delete the knowledge model editor (cannot be undone)

If there is an ongoing :ref:`knowledge model migration<knowledge-model-migration>`, there are different actions:

- **Continue migration**
- **Cancel migration**
