Documents
*********

As admins, we can quickly browse all documents stored in the |project_name| instance by navigating to :guilabel:`Documents` from the main menu. It is possible to search for a document by name or sort them using the name or creation timestamp.

Each document has a name, format, specific size (if the generation is completed), a link to the project it was generated from, and a template used for its creation. The document can be directly downloaded or deleted from the list. Additionally, we can quickly navigate to the project from which the document was created.

In case that there is a document that was not generated due to an error, we can check the error message. Also, if there are some documents got stuck in :guilabel:`Queued` or :guilabel:`In Progress` status, we should check the deployment (especially of the document worker component).
