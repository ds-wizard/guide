Question Tags
*************

If there are any :ref:`question tags<question-tag>` set up in the knowledge model, we can use the :guilabel:`Question Tags` tab to see the overview of what questions were these tags assigned to, and to assign the question tags to the questions.

We can simply click to the checkbox in the corresponding question tag - question table cell to assign/unassign the question tag to that particular question.

We can also click on specific question which will open the question in the knowledge model editor tab.
