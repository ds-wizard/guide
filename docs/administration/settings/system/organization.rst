Organization Settings
*********************

On this page, we can configure **Name**, **Description**, and **Organization ID** for our DSW instance. The organization ID can contain alphanumeric characters and dot symbol (but cannot start or end with dot).

.. NOTE::

    It is recommended to use period as for domain name or to use it for capturing organizational structure in the ID, for example, ``faculty.university`` or ``group.faculty.university``.

Another part of settings on this page are **Affiliations**. It servers to pre-define a list of possible affiliations (on per line) that will be suggested to users while they register or update their profiles.
