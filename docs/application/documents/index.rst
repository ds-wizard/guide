Documents
*********

As admins, we can quickly browse all documents stored in the DSW instance by navigating to :guilabel:`Documents` from the main menu. It is possible to search for a document by name or sort them using the name or creation timestamp.

Each document has name, format, and certain size (if the generation is finished). It can be directly downloaded or deleted from the list. Moreover, we can quickly navigate to the project from which the document is created.

In case that there is a document that was not generated due to an error, we can check the error message. Also, if there are some documents got stuck in :guilabel:`Queued` or :guilabel:`In Progress` status, we should check the deployment (especially of the document worker component).
