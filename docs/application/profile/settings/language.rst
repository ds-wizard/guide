Language
********

After navigating to :guilabel:`Language` from the :doc:`../index` menu, we can change the language of the |project_name| UI and emails. The preferred language is determined in the following order: the user's profile settings, then browser settings, and finally the default system language if the previous options are not set.

We can select one of the available languages and click :guilabel:`Save` button to apply the changes.
