Look & Feel Settings
********************

This part of settings allows us to adjust how the DSW instance looks like. 


Application Titles
==================

There are two titles that we can set. First, **Application Title** is the full title that should identify the DSW instance, for example, in browser's tab. Second is **Short Application Title** which is visibile, for example, at the top of the main (left) menu next to the icon. We should keep **Short Application Title** really short (about 10 characters at maximum) so it fits well.

Logo and Colors
===============

If enabled by deployment, we may also change the **Logo** and set **Primary Color** and **Illustrations Color** to adjust the visual style to branding of our organisation or basically to our taste.

.. NOTE::

    As this requires re-compilation of stylesheets, the deployment must be adjusted to enable this options.


Custom Menu Links
=================

We can easily add custom links to the main (left) menu by clicking :guilabel:`Add` under **Custom Menu Links**. For each link, we can set **Icon** (from `Font Awesome <https://fontawesome.com/v5/search>`_), **Title** and the target **URL**. We can also set whether the link should open in **New Window** (if not, it will nagivate user directly in the same window/tab from DSW instance). Once the links are there, we can manage them or delete them at this place.

Login Info
==========

It is possible to write a message (Markdown-enabled) that users will see before logging in the DSW instance. We can use it to explain users in what cases they can/should use our DSW instance, or how they should log in (e.g. if we have more :ref:`authentication services<auth-services>` configured).
