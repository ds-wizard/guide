From DSW Registry
=================

If the DSW instance is connected to the `DSW Registry <https://registry.ds-wizard.org>`__, it is possible to import locales from it by entering the **locale ID** of desired template (e.g. ``dsw:cs:0.2.0``) and pressing the :guilabel:`Import` button.

.. NOTE::

    In case of locales present in the `DSW Registry <https://registry.ds-wizard.org>`__, we will be notified about the available upgrades.
